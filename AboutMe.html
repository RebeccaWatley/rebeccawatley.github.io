    <p>
        I grew up in Coppell, Texas which is a small town in the Dallas area. Throughout my life,
        I have loved being involoved with sports, greek life, the community that surrounds me and learning new things. I am passionate about
        achieving personal goals and goals which are set for me here at OU. I pride myself in being
        determined, hardworking, honest, and an intellectual individual. Lastly, the opportunity to grow as
